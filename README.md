# Honeybees agent based model
Research on decision-making process in honeybees. The research focuses on the effects of disoriented bee during nesting.

# Abstract

Nest-site selection in honeybees is the process of individuating and choosing the next site where the colony will build their hive. This process is fundamental for their survival and it is a process involving hundreds of scout bees. Using an agent-based model, it is possible to simulate the beesâ€™ decision-making process when part of the population is disoriented and cannot perform the waggle dance to advertise a nest-site. Each bee has a probability to find a new nest depending on its own information and the information advertised by other bees, this information is affected by the degree of disorientation. Multiple scenarios have been simulated with various degrees of disorientation and a conservative definition of quorum. The results show that the decision-making process is robust to many degrees of disorientation. Interestingly, bees could benefit from a low degree of disorientation. This additional noise shifts the consensus towards the best site, improving the average final decision.
